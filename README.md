## Artist Top Songs from Playlist

_Script: `top-songs.py`_

Usage: `python3 top-songs.py --help`

A script that takes a playlist as input, and creates a new playlist with the top N songs for each artist in the original playlist.

__Inspiration__: If I add a newly-discovered track to one of my playlists, I often open the artists page to find more songs I like by them.
